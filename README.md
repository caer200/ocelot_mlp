# ML Potential for Molecular Crystal Relaxation

This repository provides a trained machine learning (ML) potential developed for predicting energies and forces in molecular crystals. The model enables fast and accurate geometry optimization (relaxation) of crystal structures, supporting in silico workflows for materials discovery.

Use the `relaxation.ipynb` file to run the relaxation on `test.cif`.

The `dataset.ipynb` shows how to extract the structure, energy, forces and stress from `test.cif`.

The trained model is in `m3gnet` folder

The notebooks also have corresponding `relaxation.py` and `dataset.py` files for more handsoff utilization
