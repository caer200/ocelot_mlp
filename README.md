# ML Potential for Molecular Crystal Relaxation

This repository provides a trained machine learning (ML) potential developed for predicting energies and forces in molecular crystals. The model enables fast and accurate geometry optimization (relaxation) of crystal structures, supporting in silico workflows for materials discovery.

Use the `relaxation.ipynb` file to run the relaxation on `test.cif`.

The trained model is in `m3gnet` folder
